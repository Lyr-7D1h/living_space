      content="Welcome to Living Space! This is a simulation of a small ecosystem
where creatures interact with each other and their environment. Each
creature has a unique personality based on the Big Five personality trait
that influences how they walk and interact with other creatures. For

or a more introverted creature will avoid other creatures and stay
more in place."
